# PITT_CHIP
The goal of this club is to provide interesting and informative projects for students interested in computer architecture and ASIC design. Members receive early access to industry-standard tools such as Virtuoso as well as experience with HDL/HLS scripting. 
Currently, the club is working on a hardware implementation of the Strassen Algorithm to be used in the broader context of low-latency image processing.
